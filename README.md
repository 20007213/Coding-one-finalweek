# Coding-one-finalweek

The final assessment I applied to the courses I learned this semester and more interesting knowledge to build this code.
Recently, London has entered winter, and I am also honored to see the first snow in London. During this assignment, I created a red house and snowflakes. To commemorate the first snow I saw when I came to London, and red is a warm color, and I also hope that this winter our hearts will be surrounded by warmth and love.
I created several different file libraries to monitor the status, control the perspective, generate the grid intersection and difference, generate particles, shader files, and the main class definition files. To complete the visual construction.
